Dynamic vegetation should be turned off in all the piSST set of experiments
    piSST-4xCO2                 | Same as piSST but CO2 is quadrupled. The increase in CO2 is seen by both the radiation scheme and vegetation
    piSST-4xCO2-rad             | Same as piSST but CO2 as seen by the radiation scheme is quadrupled
    piSST-4xCO2-solar           | Time slice at 1850 (picontrol) for G1ext to examine radiative forcing of abrupt4xCO2
    piSST-pxK                   | Same as piSST, but with a spatially and temporally uniform SST anomaly applied on top of the monthly-varying piSST SSTs. The magnitude of the uniform increase is taken from each model's global, climatological annual mean SST change between abrupt4xCO2 minus piControl (using the mean of years 111-140 of abrupt4xCO2, and the parallel 30-year section of piControl)
    rad-irf                     | Offline radiation calculations

    ssp245-stratO3              | Extension of stratospheric-ozone-only run under SSP2-4.5. In models with coupled chemistry, the chemistry scheme should be turned off, and the simulated ensemble mean monthly mean 3D stratospheric ozone concentrations from the SSP2-4.5 simulations should be prescribed. Tropospheric ozone should be fixed at 3D long-term monthly mean piControl values, with a value of 100 ppbv ozone concentration in this piControl climatology used to separate the troposphere from the stratosphere. In models without coupled chemistry the same stratospheric ozone prescribed in SSP2-4.5 should be prescribed. Stratospheric ozone concentrations will be provided by CCMI

    ssp585                      | Future scenario with high radiative forcing by the end of century. Following approximately RCP8.5 global forcing pathway but with new forcing based on SSP5. Concentration-driven. As a tier 2 option, this simulation should be extended to year 2300
    ssp585-bgc                  | Concentration-driven future scenario simulation, biogeochemically-coupled. This simulation should optionally be extended to year 2300
    ssp585-withism              | Future climate from ScenarioMIP SSP5-8.5 simulation that includes interactive ice sheets. Set up follows the standard SSP5-8.5 experiment
    volc-cluster-21C            | Parallel experiment to volc-cluster-ctrl, using restart files from the end of the historical simulation instead of from piControl, and boundary conditions from the 21st century SSP2-4.5 scenario experiment of ScenarioMIP

    volc-cluster-mill           | Parallel experiment to volc-cluster-ctrl but with initial conditions taken from last millennium simulation to account for the effects of a more realistic history of past natural forcing. All forcings except volcanic kept constant from year AD 1790 on
    volc-long-eq                | Idealized equatorial eruption corresponding to an initial emission of 56.2 Tg of SO2. The eruption magnitude corresponds to recent estimates for the 1815 Tambora eruption (Sigl et al., 2015), the largest historical tropical eruption, which was linked to the so-called "year without a summer" in 1816. Experiment initialized from PiControl
    volc-long-hlN               | Idealized Northern Hemisphere high-latitude eruption emitting 28.1 Tg of SO2. Experiment initialized from PiControl
